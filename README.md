# SnakeCharm
This is a test app for a future project, nothing more, nothing less.
It uses Tauri Sidecar to spawn a Python Executable, then uses the standard output and input to commmunicate.
This functionality will be rolled into a final project at a later date.

# How to Build
1. You must first build the Python Binary (see readme.md in /src-python/)

2. `yarn` To install dependencies

3. `yarn tauri build` to build
